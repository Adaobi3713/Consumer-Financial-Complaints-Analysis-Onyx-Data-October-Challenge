# 📊 Consumer Financial Complaints Analysis – Onyx Data October Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the **Onyx Data October Challenge**, focused on analyzing real consumer financial complaint data.  
The goal of this challenge was to uncover patterns in complaint types, company responses, response times, customer issues, and geographic complaint distribution.

I designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visually communicate these insights.

## 💡 Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

1. **Improve Response Time Consistency**  
   Companies should target reducing the 15-day average response time.

2. **Address High-Complaint Product Areas**  
   Products like Checking/Savings and Credit Cards need improved communication and service processes.

3. **Monitor High-Issue Categories**  
   Issues such as account management and incorrect information should be prioritized.

4. **Increase Transparency in Enforcement Cases**  
   Companies with enforcement history should implement clearer customer support protocols.

5. **Enhance Digital Channels**  
   Since most complaints come through Web and Email, optimizing these channels will improve resolution speed.
